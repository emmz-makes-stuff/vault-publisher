#
# dmons boundary tripwire — brackets every agent the Architect spawns.
#
#   usage: dmons-tripwire.sh start|stop|report
#
# Three hooks, because measuring and reporting happen in different sessions:
#
#   start   SubagentStart — records HEAD and each active change's tick count as an agent spawns.
#   stop    SubagentStop  — recomputes both when that agent finishes and, if either moved, writes
#                           a report to disk. It deliberately says nothing: a SubagentStop hook
#                           talks to the subagent, not to you, and the subagent is not the one who
#                           needs to hear it.
#   report  Stop          — runs at the end of your (the Architect's) turn and hands you whatever
#                           reports `stop` left behind.
#
# The pair is correlated by `agent_id`, which SubagentStart and SubagentStop both carry, so
# concurrent agents don't collide.
#
# This is detection, not prevention — dmons-guard.sh does the prevention. The two are not
# redundant: the guard can only block surfaces it knows about, and this catches the rest by
# looking at the outcome. It is also the only check that survives a repo where frontmatter
# hooks are skipped because the workspace was never trusted.
#
# Fails OPEN: a tripwire that breaks the Architect's turn would be worse than one that
# occasionally misses. Anything it cannot compute, it stays quiet about.
