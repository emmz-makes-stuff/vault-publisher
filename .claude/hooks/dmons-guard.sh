# dmons boundary guard — a PreToolUse hook for the OpenSpec Apply Workflow's agents.
#
#   usage: dmons-guard.sh <role>        role = worker | auditor
#
# Wired from the `hooks:` frontmatter of .claude/agents/worker*.md (role `worker`) and of
# reviewer.md / supervisor.md (role `auditor`). Frontmatter hooks fire only for that agent's
# own tool calls, so this never sees the Architect's — which is the whole point: the
# Architect must commit and tick boxes, and the agents it spawns must not.
#
# Exit 2 blocks the call; the agent reads stderr as the reason it was blocked. The agents'
# prompts already explain these boundaries. That prose is the explanation; this file is the
# enforcement, and the two must keep saying the same thing.
#
# Fails CLOSED: if it cannot parse the tool call, it blocks it.
